# SQL Execution Bug Fix - TEMPORARY vs TRANSIENT Tables

## üêõ Problem Encountered

When running `load_cash_flow_from_s3.sql` through the GitHub Actions workflow, you saw this error:

```
Error executing statement: 002003 (42S02): SQL compilation error:
Object 'CASH_FLOW_STAGE' does not exist or not authorized.
```

This occurred on the data quality check statements AFTER the COPY INTO completed successfully.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
The SQL file originally used:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE CASH_FLOW_STAGE (...)
```

**TEMPORARY tables** in Snowflake:
- Exist only within the **current session**
- Are dropped when the session ends OR when creating a new cursor
- Are **session-scoped**, not connection-scoped

### The GitHub Actions Execution Flow
The `snowflake_run_sql_file.py` helper script:
1. Splits SQL file by semicolons into separate statements
2. Executes each statement using `cursor.execute(statement)`
3. Creates a **new cursor** for each statement in some cases

**Result:** The temporary table created in one statement execution doesn't exist when the next statement tries to query it!

### Why It Worked for Balance Sheet
The balance sheet SQL used:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.BALANCE_SHEET_STAGING (...)
```

**TRANSIENT tables**:
- Persist across cursor executions within the same connection
- Are **connection-scoped**, not session-scoped
- Survive until explicitly dropped or connection closes
- Still offer performance benefits (no Fail-safe period = lower costs)

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

Changed cash flow SQL from TEMPORARY to TRANSIENT:

```sql
-- OLD (BROKEN)
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE CASH_FLOW_STAGE (...)

-- NEW (FIXED)
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.CASH_FLOW_STAGE (...)
```

### Additional Improvements
Also added **fully qualified table names** throughout for clarity:
```sql
-- All references now use full path
FROM FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.CASH_FLOW_STAGE
COPY INTO FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.CASH_FLOW_STAGE
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.CASH_FLOW_STAGE
```

## üìä When to Use Each Table Type

| Table Type | Scope | Use Case | Fail-safe | Cost |
|------------|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| **PERMANENT** | Database | Production data, long-term storage | 7 days | Highest |
| **TRANSIENT** | Database | Staging, ETL intermediate tables | 0 days | Medium |
| **TEMPORARY** | Session | Single-query intermediate results | 0 days | Lowest |

### Our ETL Pattern
- **PERMANENT**: `CASH_FLOW`, `BALANCE_SHEET` (final destination tables)
- **TRANSIENT**: `CASH_FLOW_STAGE`, `BALANCE_SHEET_STAGING` (ETL staging tables)
- **TEMPORARY**: Not used in GitHub Actions workflows (session issues)

## üéØ Best Practices for GitHub Actions SQL

1. **Never use TEMPORARY tables** in SQL files executed via `snowflake_run_sql_file.py`
2. **Always use TRANSIENT** for staging/intermediate tables in ETL
3. **Use fully qualified names** for clarity and debugging
4. **Drop staging tables** at the end to clean up (happens automatically on connection close anyway)

## üîß Testing Verification

After this fix, the workflow should:
1. ‚úÖ Create CASH_FLOW_STAGE as TRANSIENT table
2. ‚úÖ Load data via COPY INTO
3. ‚úÖ Run data quality checks successfully
4. ‚úÖ Execute MERGE into target table
5. ‚úÖ Drop staging table
6. ‚úÖ Complete without errors
