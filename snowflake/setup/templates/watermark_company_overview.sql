COMPANY_OVERVIEW WATERMARKS INITIALIZED

Key Differences from Fundamentals ETLs:
- Staleness threshold: 365 days (vs 135 days for balance sheet/cash flow/income statement)
- Rationale: Company profile data (sector, industry, description) changes infrequently
- More frequent updates would waste API quota on unchanged data
- Annual refresh is sufficient for most company overview information

Next steps:
1. Run the GitHub Actions workflow:
   .github/workflows/company_overview_watermark_etl.yml

2. Test with a small batch first:
   - Set max_symbols: 5
   - Leave exchange_filter blank
   - Monitor execution

3. After successful test:
   - Remove max_symbols limit
   - Let it process all eligible symbols (~8,000 active stocks)
   - Future runs will use 365-day staleness logic

4. Check watermark updates:
   SELECT * FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = ''COMPANY_OVERVIEW'' 
   ORDER BY LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN DESC LIMIT 20;

5. Verify data loaded:
   SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT SECTOR), COUNT(DISTINCT INDUSTRY)
   FROM COMPANY_OVERVIEW;

6. Expected behavior after initial run:
   - Most symbols will have LAST_FISCAL_DATE = current date
   - Next scheduled run (quarterly) will skip most symbols
   - Only NEW symbols or symbols >365 days old will be processed
   - This saves API quota and reduces processing time

Quarterly Schedule:
- Workflow scheduled to run: 1st of Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct at 6:00 AM UTC
- Can also trigger manually via workflow_dispatch
