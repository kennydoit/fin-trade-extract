INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS WATERMARKS INITIALIZED

Key differences from fundamentals ETL:
- NO staleness check (insider trading is sporadic and unpredictable)
- Companies may have zero transactions for months (this is normal)
- Some companies have frequent insider activity, others have none
- Run monthly to capture recent insider trading activity

Next steps:
1. Run the GitHub Actions workflow:
   .github/workflows/insider_transactions_watermark_etl.yml

2. Test with a small batch first:
   - Set max_symbols: 10
   - Leave exchange_filter blank
   - Monitor execution

3. Expected behavior:
   - Many symbols will have "no data" (normal for insider transactions)
   - Some symbols will have transactions (executives buying/selling)
   - Watermarks track LAST_FISCAL_DATE = latest transaction date
   - No staleness check (always re-fetch when run)

4. After successful test:
   - Remove max_symbols limit
   - Run monthly via schedule or manually
   - Use skip_recent_hours to avoid re-processing same day

5. Check watermark updates:
   SELECT * FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = ''INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS'' 
   ORDER BY LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN DESC LIMIT 20;

6. Verify data loaded:
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT SYMBOL) as symbols_with_activity,
       MIN(TRANSACTION_DATE) as earliest_transaction,
       MAX(TRANSACTION_DATE) as latest_transaction
   FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS;

7. View recent insider activity:
   SELECT SYMBOL, TRANSACTION_DATE, OWNER_NAME, 
          ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION, SHARES, VALUE
   FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
   WHERE TRANSACTION_DATE >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())
   ORDER BY TRANSACTION_DATE DESC
   LIMIT 20;
