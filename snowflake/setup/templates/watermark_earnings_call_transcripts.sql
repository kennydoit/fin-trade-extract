EARNINGS_CALL_TRANSCRIPT WATERMARKS INITIALIZED

Key differences from other ETLs:
- One API call per symbol per quarter (not just per symbol)
- Only fetch for valid fiscal quarters (2010 Q1 onward, or first full quarter after IPO)
- Only process active stocks for now
- If no data for all quarters, set API_ELIGIBLE = ''SUS''
- Watermarks track FIRST_FISCAL_DATE and LAST_FISCAL_DATE for transcript data

Next steps:
1. Run the GitHub Actions workflow:
   .github/workflows/earnings_call_transcripts_watermark_etl.yml

2. Test with a small batch first:
   - Set max_symbols: 10
   - Leave exchange_filter blank
   - Monitor execution

3. Expected behavior:
   - Many symbols/quarters will have "no data" (normal for transcripts)
   - Some symbols will have transcripts
   - Watermarks track LAST_FISCAL_DATE = latest transcript date

4. After successful test:
   - Remove max_symbols limit
   - Run monthly via schedule or manually

5. Check watermark updates:
   SELECT * FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = ''EARNINGS_CALL_TRANSCRIPT'' 
   ORDER BY LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN DESC LIMIT 20;

6. Verify data loaded:
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as total_transcripts,
       COUNT(DISTINCT SYMBOL) as symbols_with_transcripts,
       MIN(TRANSCRIPT_DATE) as earliest_transcript,
       MAX(TRANSCRIPT_DATE) as latest_transcript
   FROM EARNINGS_CALL_TRANSCRIPTS;

7. View recent transcripts:
   SELECT SYMBOL, TRANSCRIPT_DATE, FISCAL_QUARTER, CEO_NAME, 
          TITLE, SUMMARY
   FROM EARNINGS_CALL_TRANSCRIPTS
   WHERE TRANSCRIPT_DATE >= DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE())
   ORDER BY TRANSCRIPT_DATE DESC
   LIMIT 20;
