INCOME_STATEMENT WATERMARKS INITIALIZED

Next steps:
1. Run the GitHub Actions workflow:
   .github/workflows/income_statement_watermark_etl.yml

2. Test with a small batch first:
   - Set max_symbols: 5
   - Leave exchange_filter blank
   - Monitor execution

3. After successful test:
   - Remove max_symbols limit
   - Let it process all eligible symbols
   - Future runs will use 135-day staleness logic

4. Check watermark updates:
   SELECT * FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = ''INCOME_STATEMENT'' 
   ORDER BY LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN DESC LIMIT 20;

5. Verify data loaded:
   SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(FISCAL_DATE_ENDING), MAX(FISCAL_DATE_ENDING)
   FROM INCOME_STATEMENT;
