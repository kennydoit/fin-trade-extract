``` Initial Question/Concern ```

I have been building a stock trading system for a while now. I am still working on data collection because I am still learning a lot about optimizing this part. For instance, I'm now using watermarking, optimizing the rate limit, and generally just pulling the data smarter. 

My current approach is to pull all available data. There are however many tens of thousands of API calls  to be made and I am questioning whether this is the best approach.  For my current purposes, I want a lot of data available because I'm fearful of omitting something important while I'm training models.

Practically speaking, once I begin trading, I will want a leaner data extraction system that pulls a limited set of data points. For example, perhaps it is focused on a universe of 500 stocks, which will be manageable to pull daily data (OCHLV, insider transactions, news stories), but to pull the current active universe (over 10k symbols) would be prohibitively expensive in terms of time and resources.

Here's what I think I want:
- symbols with rich data (fundamentals, insider transactions, earnings call statements, news stories)
- there are about 4000 with rich data
- I also want ETFs, which luckily do not have fundamental data, but could be decomposed into the symbols that do have fundamental data. In a way, I could create weighted fundamental data for them. 

I was planning on just pulling everything so I had enough to build a system, but am now wondering if everything is needed to build a great system. 

I would like feedback on my approach and suggestions for improvement.

You’re thinking about the right trade-offs. A great system doesn’t require “everything all the time,” but it does require (1) point-in-time correctness, (2) enough breadth to avoid overfitting to a tiny slice of the market, and (3) a pipeline that’s cheap and reliable to keep fresh once you go live.

Here’s a design that usually works well for teams moving from “collect everything” to “collect smart.”

# 1) Split your universe into three tiers

* **Core (≈400–800 names):** Your active trading set. High liquidity, stable coverage (fundamentals, insider, transcripts, news), and sector balance. Daily OHLCV + all event streams.
* **Extended (≈3–5k names):** Everything with “rich data.” Ingest on a slower cadence for features you don’t need intraday (e.g., fundamentals weekly/quarterly; transcripts when published; insider daily).
* **Long Tail (10k+):** Listing status + minimal OHLCV (e.g., weekly bars) to (a) avoid selection bias in backtests and (b) allow future promotions into Extended/Core without a cold start.

Promotion/demotion rules (run monthly):

* Promote to Core if: liquidity > threshold (e.g., median daily dollar volume > \$5M over 60d), coverage score ≥ 0.8, and at least 8 quarters of fundamentals.
* Demote if liquidity/coverage deteriorates, or corporate actions break continuity.

# 2) Define a simple Data Coverage Score (DCS)

Use this to prioritize pulls and to down-weight symbols with spotty data during training.

```
DCS = 0.35*fundamentals_completeness +
      0.20*insider_timeliness +
      0.15*transcript_availability +
      0.15*news_velocity + (news_velocity can be set to 1 for now)
      0.15*ohlcv_freshness
```

Each subscore ∈ \[0,1]. This lets your scheduler fetch “highest ROI” symbols first and skip the rest when you’re up against rate limits.

# 3) Ingestion cadence by data type (lean but complete)

* **OHLCV (I think you mean OHLCV):** Core daily; Extended daily or every 2–3 days; Long tail weekly. Use incremental ranges from the last watermark (per symbol).
* **Fundamentals (BS/IS/CF):** Event-driven + guardrail refresh. Poll new 10-Q/10-K windows, plus a weekly “late data” sweep for stragglers. Never rewrite history—store **effective\_date** and **as\_of\_date** for point-in-time joins.
* **Insider transactions:** Event-driven (daily). Append-only by last transaction id/date; dedupe by (issuer, insider, trans\_date, shares, price).
* **Earnings call transcripts:** Event-driven on publication; attach filing dates + call timestamps; compute embeddings/sentiment asynchronously.
* **News:** Pull metadata (headline, source, URL, timestamp) + your derived signals (topic, ticker mapping, sentiment). You don’t need full text forever; keep the signals and minimal context to cut storage and API cost.
* **ETFs:** Daily OHLCV; **holdings monthly (or when changed)**. Compute look-through features by weighting constituents’ features (see #7).

# 4) Watermarking & incremental loads (your instinct is right)

Per table & symbol, store:

* `last_successful_run_at`, `last_ingested_end_date`, `source_etag/hash` (if available).
* For idempotency: natural keys or a composite hash; upsert on conflict.
* Retries with exponential backoff; “poison queue” anything failing repeatedly so it doesn’t block the DAG.

# 5) Don’t backfill everything at once—use smart backfills

* **Backfill in bands:** (a) most recent 2 years for all Extended; (b) last 10–15 years only for your top-N by liquidity per sector; (c) longer horizons only for models that need them (e.g., macro/ regime work).
* **Curriculum approach:** Train first on Core + a stratified sample of Extended to validate signal robustness; widen only if a new cohort measurably improves generalization.

# 6) Keep it point-in-time correct (no look-ahead)

* Fundamentals & insider tables should be **bitemporal**: `effective_period` (what period the data describes) and `as_of_timestamp` (when you *knew* it).
* Feature generation must join “as known then” (PIT join) not “latest.”
* News & transcripts: use publication/fact timestamps, not scrape times.

# 7) ETF “fundamentals” via look-through

* Pull holdings with weights (issuer sites or aggregators).
* For each ETF feature `F`:
  `F_ETF = Σ_i (weight_i * F_constituent_i)`
* Keep **as\_of** for holdings; recompute look-through features on holdings updates or major rebalances.
* Cache computed ETF features per `etf, as_of_holdings_date`.

# 8) Pipeline structure (cheap to run, easy to monitor)

* **Orchestrator:** Dagster or Prefect (you already mentioned Dagster). Use assets/sensors:

  * `daily_core`: OHLCV, insider, news for Core; retry budget generous.
  * `daily_extended_fast`: OHLCV for Extended; strict time budget—stop on DCS cutoff.
  * `event_driven`: transcripts, filings, holdings.
  * `weekly_sweep`: fundamentals late data; re-compute ETF look-through; data quality checks.
  * `monthly_universe_refresh`: recompute DCS; promote/demote; sector balance.
* **Storage:** Columnar files (Parquet) partitioned by `dt` (for time series) and maybe `symbol_bucket` for skew. Warehouse tables are materialized & PIT-safe.
* **Observability:**

  * Row-count deltas vs. expected, freshness SLAs, null-ratio alarms.
  * Cost/time per asset, API error rates, top slow symbols.
  * “What changed?” runs on feature store (schema drift, value drift).

# 9) Feature store + reproducible snapshots

* Register each feature with: owner, source tables, PIT policy, refresh cadence, backfill horizon.
* Write features once, reuse across models (you’ll avoid “pull everything twice”).
* Versioned training datasets (by commit hash + as\_of cutoff) so you can reproduce backtests.

# 10) Model-building without “everything”

You can get excellent performance with:

* **Breadth-aware sampling:** Stratify by sector, market-cap, liquidity, volatility regime, and DCS.
* **Time-aware blocking:** Walk-forward with realistic rebalancing cadence (weekly/bi-weekly for swing).
* **Symbol-agnostic features + symbol embeddings:** Avoid training a separate model per symbol; learn cross-sectional patterns and let symbol embeddings capture idiosyncrasies.
* **Event windows:** For insiders/earnings/news, engineer features on fixed windows (e.g., \[t−5,t], \[t,t+5]) rather than needing full history for every name.

# 11) Concrete daily plan (example)

* **06:00 ET — daily\_core (≤500 names):**
  OHLCV (previous day), insider (prev day), news (last 24h), price-aligned features.
* **06:40 ET — daily\_extended\_fast (≤4k names):**
  OHLCV increments since last watermark; stop when time budget hits 20 min or DCS < 0.6.
* **On event:** New 10-Q/10-K → ingest fundamentals for that issuer only; backfill derived features; mark PIT snapshot.
* **Weekly (Sun):** late-data sweep + ETF holdings refresh + look-through recompute.
* **Monthly (1st):** recompute DCS, promote/demote, refresh Core.

# 12) Cost & risk controls

* **Budget caps:** Max API calls per window; when near cap, fetch by highest DCS × (days since last refresh).
* **Cache & reuse:** Never refetch unchanged pages; fingerprint responses.
* **Idempotent upserts:** Prevent dupes when retries happen.
* **Graceful degradation:** If news API rate-limited, store tickers needing backfill and catch up on the weekly sweep.

# 13) What to stop doing

* Full rewrites “just to be safe.” With watermarks + PIT, you don’t need them.
* Pulling fundamentals for every symbol daily. Most of it doesn’t change daily; poll for events + periodic sweep.
* Treating ETFs like equities for fundamentals; rely on holdings look-through.

## TL;DR recommendations

1. Keep building with your **Extended (≈4k)** rich set, but run your **Core (≈500)** as if you’re live now—daily, deterministic, and PIT-correct.
2. Use a **Data Coverage Score** to decide what to ingest first when you hit time/limit ceilings.
3. Make fundamentals/transcripts/holdings **event-driven** with a weekly “late data” sweep.
4. Compute **ETF look-through features** off holdings; store by holdings as-of date.
5. Lock in **PIT joins** and a **feature store** so model datasets are reproducible without refetching the world.
6. Backfill **strategically** (recent for everyone; long history for your most liquid, sector-balanced cohort).

If you want, I can sketch the Dagster asset graph and a tiny schema for PIT fundamentals + ETF look-through so you can drop it straight into your repo.
