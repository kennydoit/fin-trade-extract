- **Rate Limit**: 75 calls/minute (premium tier recommended)
- **Data Returned**: Executive/director buy/sell transactions

### API Response Structure
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "transactionDate": "2025-10-01",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Snowflake Table: INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
**Table**: `FIN_TRADE_EXTRACT.RAW.INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS`

**Columns (12 data + 2 metadata)**:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `SYMBOL` | VARCHAR(20) | Stock ticker |
| `TRANSACTION_DATE` | DATE | When the transaction occurred |
| `FILING_DATE` | DATE | When the transaction was filed with SEC |
| `OWNER_NAME` | VARCHAR(255) | Name of insider (executive/director) |
| `OWNER_TITLE` | VARCHAR(255) | Title/position (CEO, CFO, Director, etc.) |
| `TRANSACTION_TYPE` | VARCHAR(100) | Type of transaction |
| `ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION` | VARCHAR(20) | 'A' (buy) or 'D' (sell) |

**Primary Key**: `(SYMBOL, TRANSACTION_DATE, OWNER_NAME, SECURITY_TYPE)`

**Important**: Same person can have multiple transactions on same date in different securities.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Watermarks (ONE-TIME SETUP)

**Run this SQL script in Snowflake** to create watermark records:

```sql
-- File: snowflake/setup/templates/watermark_insider_transactions.sql
```

This creates `ETL_WATERMARKS` records for all active stocks. You can execute it via:
- Snowflake Web UI (Worksheets)
- SnowSQL command line
- OR use the automated workflow (recommended):
  - Go to GitHub Actions
  - Run `Add Data Source Watermarks` workflow
  - Select `INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS` from dropdown

**What it does**:
- Creates watermark entry for each symbol in `SYMBOL` table
- Sets `API_ELIGIBLE = 'YES'` for active common stocks only
- Sets `API_ELIGIBLE = 'NO'` for ETFs, delisted stocks, etc.
- Initial state: `LAST_FISCAL_DATE = NULL` (will be set on first run)

**Verify watermarks created**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS' AND API_ELIGIBLE = 'YES';

-- Should return ~2000-3000 active stocks
```

### Step 2: Test with Small Batch

**Run the GitHub Actions workflow** with test parameters:

1. Go to **GitHub Actions** ‚Üí **Insider Transactions ETL - Watermark Based**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Set parameters:
   - `exchange_filter`: Leave blank (or select NYSE for smaller test)
   - `max_symbols`: **10** (test with 10 symbols first)
   - `skip_recent_hours`: Leave blank
   - `batch_size`: **100** (default)

4. Click **Run workflow**

**Expected results**:
- Workflow takes ~2-3 minutes for 10 symbols
- Many symbols may have "no data" (this is NORMAL for insider transactions)
- Some symbols will have transactions (executives buying/selling)
- Check Snowflake: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS;`

### Step 3: Verify Data Quality

**Check data loaded correctly**:

```sql
-- Total transactions loaded
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT SYMBOL) as symbols_with_activity,
    MIN(TRANSACTION_DATE) as earliest_transaction,
    MAX(TRANSACTION_DATE) as latest_transaction
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS;

-- Breakdown by acquisition/disposition
SELECT 
    ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(SHARES) as total_shares
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION;

-- Recent insider activity (last 30 days)
SELECT 
    SYMBOL,
    TRANSACTION_DATE,
    OWNER_NAME,
    OWNER_TITLE,
    ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION,
    SHARES,
    VALUE
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE TRANSACTION_DATE >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())
ORDER BY TRANSACTION_DATE DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Step 4: Check Watermarks Updated

**Verify watermarks were updated after successful extraction**:

```sql
SELECT 
    SYMBOL,
    FIRST_FISCAL_DATE,     -- Earliest transaction date
    LAST_FISCAL_DATE,      -- Latest transaction date
    LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN,   -- When ETL last ran
    CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES
FROM ETL_WATERMARKS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS'
  AND LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected**:
- `FIRST_FISCAL_DATE`: Set to earliest transaction date (or current date if no transactions)
- `LAST_FISCAL_DATE`: Set to latest transaction date (or current date if no transactions)
- `LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN`: Set to current timestamp
- `CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`: Reset to 0

### Step 5: Run Full Processing

**Once test is successful**, run with full parameters:

1. Go to **GitHub Actions** ‚Üí **Insider Transactions ETL - Watermark Based**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Set parameters:
   - `exchange_filter`: Leave blank (all exchanges)
   - `max_symbols`: Leave blank (all eligible symbols)
   - `skip_recent_hours`: **720** (30 days - avoid re-processing recent runs)
   - `batch_size`: **100** (default)

4. Click **Run workflow**

**Expected**:
- Processes ~2000-3000 symbols (all active stocks)
- Takes 2-4 hours (depending on API rate limit)
- Many symbols will have no insider transactions (normal)
- Updates watermarks for all processed symbols

## üìÖ Scheduling & Incremental Updates

### Automated Monthly Schedule

The workflow runs automatically on the **1st of each month at 4 AM UTC**:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 4 1 * *'
```

**Why monthly?**
- Insider trading is sporadic and unpredictable
- Companies may have no transactions for months
- Monthly runs capture recent activity without excessive API calls

### Manual Runs

For on-demand updates:

1. **Recent Activity Update** (last 30 days):
   - `skip_recent_hours`: **720** (30 days)
   - Processes only symbols not updated in last 30 days

2. **Quarterly Refresh** (every 90 days):
   - `skip_recent_hours`: **2160** (90 days)
   - Good for quarterly reviews

3. **Force Full Refresh** (all symbols):
   - `skip_recent_hours`: Leave blank
   - Processes ALL eligible symbols (use sparingly)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Differences from Fundamentals ETL

### NO Staleness Check

**Fundamentals** (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Income Statement):
- Use 135-day staleness check
- Only fetch if data is likely updated (quarterly cycle)
- Saves API quota

**Insider Transactions**:
- **NO staleness check**
- Always fetch latest data when run
- Insider trading is unpredictable (can happen anytime)

**Why no staleness?**
- A company might have 0 transactions for 6 months, then 10 in one week
- Quarterly filings are predictable, insider trading is not
- We want to capture recent activity whenever we run

### Expected "No Data" Responses

**This is NORMAL for insider transactions**:
- Many companies have no recent insider trading
- ETL will report "no data" for these symbols
- Watermarks still get updated (LAST_SUCCESSFUL_RUN set)
- This is not a failure - it's expected behavior

**Example**:
- Run on 1,000 symbols
- 800 symbols: "no data" (no insider transactions)
- 200 symbols: transactions found
- All 1,000 watermarks updated successfully

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No symbols to process"

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ETL_WATERMARKS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS' AND API_ELIGIBLE = 'YES';
```

**If count = 0**:
- Watermarks not initialized
- Run Step 1: Initialize Watermarks

**If count > 0**:
- Check `skip_recent_hours` parameter
- All symbols may have been processed recently

### Issue: All symbols return "no data"

**This is NORMAL**:
- Insider trading is sporadic
- Many companies have no recent transactions
- Check a few large-cap stocks manually:
  - AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL should have some activity
  - If those also have "no data", check API key/endpoint

**Verify API access**:
```bash
curl "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS&symbol=IBM&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Issue: Rate limit errors

**Symptoms**:
- Workflow stops mid-processing
- "Rate limited" messages in logs

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `batch_size` to 50 (slower but safer)
2. Use `max_symbols` to process in smaller chunks
3. Verify you have premium API tier (75 calls/minute)

### Issue: Duplicate transactions

**Check for duplicates**:
```sql
SELECT 
    SYMBOL, TRANSACTION_DATE, OWNER_NAME, SECURITY_TYPE,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY SYMBOL, TRANSACTION_DATE, OWNER_NAME, SECURITY_TYPE
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Should return 0 rows** (primary key prevents duplicates)

**If duplicates exist**:
- SQL MERGE logic may have issue
- Report as bug for investigation

### Issue: Watermarks not updating

**Check if connection closed properly**:
```sql
-- Check for long-running warehouse sessions
SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY())
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'FIN_TRADE_WH'
  AND END_TIME IS NULL
  AND START_TIME < DATEADD(hour, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY START_TIME;
```

**If found**:
- Python script may have crashed before closing connection
- Manually close connections in Snowflake UI
- Review workflow logs for Python errors

## üìà Data Quality Checks

### Automated Checks (in SQL load script)

The SQL loader performs these checks:

1. **Missing required fields**: SYMBOL, TRANSACTION_DATE, OWNER_NAME, SECURITY_TYPE
2. **Invalid transaction dates**: Non-parseable dates
3. **Invalid filing dates**: Non-parseable dates
4. **Invalid A/D codes**: Must be 'A' or 'D'
5. **Invalid share amounts**: Non-numeric values

**View check results** in Snowflake after load:
- Check query output from `load_insider_transactions_from_s3.sql`
- Should show 0 issues for each check

### Manual Quality Checks

**Check for reasonable data distribution**:
```sql
-- Should have mix of buys (A) and sells (D)
SELECT 
    ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as pct
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY ACQUISITION_DISPOSITION;

-- Should have various transaction types
SELECT 
    TRANSACTION_TYPE,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY TRANSACTION_TYPE
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Should have data across time (not all recent)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('year', TRANSACTION_DATE) as year,
    COUNT(*) as transactions
FROM INSIDER_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year DESC;
```
